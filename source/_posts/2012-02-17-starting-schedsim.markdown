I am now required (for a class) to create a *CPU scheduling simulator*. Which will be fun.

For now I'm mostly contemplating how to implement… well… any of it, really. I'm sure it'll
be an interesting experience. All I have at the moment is a quick UI mockup I threw together
for the sake of the "proposal" – which is something of a misnomer, since there wasn't any
real proposing going on, but oh well.

I'm somewhat undecided on if I should expand those bars vertically to be somewhat more like
the thing below, though I suspect the answer is probably "yes."

The whole user interface is probably weeks away at this point, though. We shall see!
